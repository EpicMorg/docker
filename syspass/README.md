---

### Production

The best way to get it running is by installing through docker-compose. You will get a fully working sysPass environment with its database.

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuxsmin/docker-syspass/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose -p syspass up -d
```

Please be aware that you will need to setup a database if you choose to build the sysPass-only container.

### Development

If you want to test/develop the current release, please deploy it from https://github.com/nuxsmin/docker-syspass/tree/master/sysPass-dev through docker-compose:

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuxsmin/docker-syspass/master/sysPass-dev/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose -p syspassdev up -d
```

or pull it:

```
$ docker run --name sysPass-app-devel syspass/syspass:3.1.x-dev
```

Please be aware that you will need to setup a database if you choose to build the sysPass-only container.

## To-Do List ‚úîÔ∏è

- [x] Integrate the free GPT API into the WebUI
- [x] Create Docker support
- [x] Improve the Jailbreak functionality
- [x] Add the GPT-4 model
- [x] Enhance the user interface
- [ ] Auto Proxy
- [ ] Enable editing and creating Jailbreaks in the WebUI
- [ ] Migrate the interface to React.js (?)

## Getting Started :white_check_mark:  
To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository and have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.  
  
### Cloning the Repository :inbox_tray:
Run the following command to clone the repository:  

```
git clone https://github.com/ramonvc/gptfree-jailbreak-webui.git
```

### Install Dependencies :wrench: 
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd gptfree-jailbreak-webui
```

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application :rocket:
To run the application, run the following command:
```
python run.py
```

Access the application in your browser using the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1338
```
or
```
http://localhost:1338
```
## Auto Proxy üîë  
The application includes an auto proxy feature that allows it to work with multiple free proxy servers. 
The freeGPT API refuses some connections, especially when hosted in the cloud (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud). 
Auto proxy solves this problem automatically for you. 
When enabled, the application will automatically fetch and test proxy servers, updating the list of working proxies every 30 minutes.  
  
### Enable Auto Proxy
To enable it, just go to the `config.json` file and change the value of the "use_auto_proxy" to `true`.  

```
"use_auto_proxy": true
```

## Docker üê≥
### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) on your machine.

### Running the Docker
Build the Docker image:
```
docker-compose build
```

Run the application using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up
```

Access the application in your browser using the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1338
```
or
```
http://localhost:1338
```

When you're done using the application, stop the Docker containers using the following command:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Incorporated Projects :busts_in_silhouette:
I highly recommend visiting and supporting both projects.

### WebUI
The application interface was incorporated from the [chatgpt-clone](https://github.com/xtekky/chatgpt-clone) repository.

### API G4F
The free GPT-4 API was incorporated from the [GPT4Free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free) repository.

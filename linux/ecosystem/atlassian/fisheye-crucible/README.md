# Overview

This Docker container makes it easy to get an instance of Fisheye/Crucible up and running.

# Quick Start

For the `FISHEYE_INST` directory that is used to store the application data (amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/data-volumes), or via a named volume if using a docker version >= 1.9. 

To get started you can use a data volume, or named volumes. In this example we'll use named volumes.

    $> docker volume create --name fecruVolume
    $> docker run -v fecruVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/fecru --name="fecru" -d -p 8060:8060 epicmorg/fisheye-crucible


**Success**. Fisheye/Crucible is now available on [http://localhost:8060](http://localhost:8060)*

Please ensure your container has the necessary resources allocated to it. We recommend 1GiB of memory allocated to accommodate the application server. See [Supported Platforms](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/supported-platforms-298976955.html) for further information.
    

_* Note: If you are using `docker-machine` on Mac OS X, please use `open http://$(docker-machine ip default):8060` instead._

## Memory / Heap Size

If you need to override Fisheye/Crucible's default memory allocation, you can control the minimum heap (Xms) and maximum heap (Xmx) via the below environment variables.

* `JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY` (default: NONE)

   The minimum heap size of the JVM

* `JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY` (default: 1024m)

   The maximum heap size of the JVM


## JVM configuration

If you need to pass additional JVM arguments to Fisheye/Crucible, such as specifying a custom trust store, you can add them via the below environment variable

* `FISHEYE_OPTS`

   Additional JVM arguments for Fisheye/Crucible

* `JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS`

   Additional JVM arguments for Fisheye/Crucible. These are appended to `FISHEYE_OPTS`; this option exists only for consistency with other Atlassian Docker images.


## Other configuration

Additional configuration options are available to Fisheye/Crucible:

* `FISHEYE_ARGS`

   The arguments which will be passed to Fisheye when it is started. You can set this to --debug, for example, or --debug-perf if you always want to have Fisheye debugging put into the Fisheye log files. See also [Command line options](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/command-line-options-298976950.html)
   
* `FISHEYE_LIBRARY_PATH`

   Used to tell Fisheye where it should look to load any additional native libraries

   
Example:

    $> docker run -e JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/var/atlassian/application-data/fecru/cacerts -v fecruVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/fecru --name="fecru" -d -p 8060:8060 epicmorg/fisheye-crucible

# Upgrade

To upgrade to a more recent version of Fisheye/Crucible you can simply stop the `fecru` container and start a new one based on a more recent image:

    $> docker stop fecru
    $> docker rm fecru
    $> docker run ... (See above)

As your data is stored in the data volume directory on the host it will still  be available after the upgrade.

_Note: Please make sure that you **don't** accidentally remove the `fecru` container and its volumes using the `-v` option._

# Backup

For evaluations you can use the built-in database that will store its files in the Fisheye/Crucible home directory. In that case it is sufficient to create a backup archive of the docker volume.

If you're using an external database, you can configure Fisheye/Crucible to make a backup automatically each night. This will back up the current state, including the database to the `fecruVolume` docker volume, which can then be archived. Alternatively you can backup the database separately, and continue to create a backup archive of the docker volume to back up the `FISHEYE_INST` directory.

# Versioning

The `latest` tag matches the most recent release of Atlassian Fisheye/Crucible. Thus `epicmorg/fisheye-crucible:latest` will use the newest version of Fisheye/Crucible available.

Alternatively you can use a specific major, major.minor, or major.minor.patch version of Fisheye/Crucible by using a version number tag:

* `epicmorg/fisheye-crucible:4`
* `epicmorg/fisheye-crucible:4.6`
* `epicmorg/fisheye-crucible:4.6.1`

All versions from 3.0+ are available

# Support

This Docker container is unsupported and is intended for illustration purposes only.
